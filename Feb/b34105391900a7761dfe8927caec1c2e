Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta is a man under immense pressure to walk the talk in the fight against corruption. Anxiety is mounting for the head of state to crack the whip on cabinet secretaries grossly named in the multi-billion dams scandals in Elgeyo Marakwet County. It is now official that at least two cabinet secretaries have been questioned by the Directorate of criminal investigations in the 63 billion shillings scam that has been described as Kenyaâ€™s biggest scandal yet since the Goldenberg scandal of the 90s.
