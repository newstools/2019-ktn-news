The ministry of water and sanitation has admitted that counties do not have the capacity to absorb key water projects currently being undertaken by the national government. Water and sanitation cs, Simon Chelugui says a proper policy is required to guide the transfer and the issue was before the council of governors. Chelugui made the remarks when he met the committees of environment and national resources of the national assembly and senate on the draft national water policy at Sawela lodge in Naivasha.
