The council of governors has distanced itself from the nursesâ€™ strike that is expected to begin tonight affecting 11 counties. Through a letter sent to Kenya national union of nurses (KNUN) the cog has distanced itself from negations between the union and counties. The union has asked the councilto consult each county individually. Only nurses in mombasa, Migori, Machakos, Tharaka Nithi, Vihiga and Mandera counties have been paid the allowances or promised payment as agreed in the 2017 return to work formula
