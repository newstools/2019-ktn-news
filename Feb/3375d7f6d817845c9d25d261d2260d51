Itâ€™s turning out that the killers of Mary Wambui may have hired another motorist to ferry her body from Four Ways junction estate on Kiambu road where the incident is said to have happened, to Juja, where it was found a day later. A Kiambu court has today granted investigators 7 days to detain Michael Githae in order to complete investigations into the murder.
