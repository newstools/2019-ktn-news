There was chaos and a near fist fight once again at the Kisumu county assembly after the chair of the budget committee Steven Owiti was replaced by central ward MCA Judith Ogada. The MCAâ€™s also protested about the order paper that had been presented before the house and accused Speaker Onyango Oloo of dictating operations at the assembly.
