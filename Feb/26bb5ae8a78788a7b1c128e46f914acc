The leadership standoff between three factions of the African Independent Pentecostal church (AIPCA) could escalate as one of the group’s leader most reverend arc Bishop Julius Njoroge declared having been duly registered as the legitimate bishop under the societies act. The wrangles between Julius Njoroge, Fredrick Wang’ombe and Samuel Muthuri commenced after the retirement of Archbishop Amos Kabuthu who rose to the position in 2013 at a ceremony witnessed by former president Mwai Kibaki. A dialogue between the three which lasted for five months was initiated in March 2017 with each side required to bring on the table their pressing issues in a bid to form a united front that will steer the church leadership.
