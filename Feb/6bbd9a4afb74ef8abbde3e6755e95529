The controversy surrounding the Wajir gubernatorial case, where the Supreme Court of Kenya in a majority decision, upheld the win of Mohamed Abdi Mohamud, has now been seized by the Judicial Service Commission.  On Thursday, Chief Justice and president of the Supreme Court of Kenya, David Maraga, tabled before the Judicial Service Commission for consideration, a petition by lawyer Ahmednassir Abdullahi that accused certain Supreme Court judges of being compromised to rule in the incumbent’s favour. However, Lawyer Nelson Havi who represented Governor Mohamed Abdi has dismissed the petition terming it a red herring and propaganda.
