The Kenyan government will soon roll out a 33 billion Kenya social and economic inclusion programme under the Inua Jamii project. Speaking at state house Nairobi president Uhuru Kenyatta affirmed that the intervention is aimed at accelerating the socioeconomic transformation of the country and restoring dignity for the most vulnerable Kenyans. The Inua Jamii is a social safety net program aimed at disbursing funds to the elderly in a move to uplift their living standards in old age.
