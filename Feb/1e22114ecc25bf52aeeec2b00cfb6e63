In the face of endless cattle rustling and banditry, elders from West Pokot, Baringo and Elgeyo Marakwet counties conducted an old Kalenjin practice employed as a last resort to the menace of cattle rustling. With the weight of approval from their culture, the elders conducted a cursing ceremony to curse the cattle rustlers who have been wrecking havoc in the volatile Kerio valley.
