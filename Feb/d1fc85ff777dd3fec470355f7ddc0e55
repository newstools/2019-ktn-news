Health services in 13 counties have been paralyzed following the nurses' strike which entered its second week today. Nurses under the national government employed by the ministry of health joined the strike together with 4 otherÂ counties. This came even as the labour Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yattani asked nurses to call off their strike as a show of good faith and commitment to the ongoing conciliatory talks with other stakeholders.
