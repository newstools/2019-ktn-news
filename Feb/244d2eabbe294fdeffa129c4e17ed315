Mombasa Governor Ali Hassan Joho has called on Deputy President Dr Wiliam Ruto to face him directly and not via proxies.
 
Speaking when he accompanied Irshad Sumra as the former MP submitted his nomination papers to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission on Monday, Joho said he won’t be cowed.
 
He claimed that DP Ruto was using his allies to fight him, a move he said will not work.
 
Governor Joho further alleged that the DP was the most corrupt person in the country and vowed to stop his ascend to the top seat come 2022.
