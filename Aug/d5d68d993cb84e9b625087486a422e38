The Acting Cabinet Secretary, who was on a familiarisation tour of the KRA operations at the Inland Container Depot (ICD) in Embakasi today, said that automation of tax administration functions is key in enhancing both transparency and efficiency. He added that automation of KRA processes has reduced human intervention in handling cargo right from the Port of Mombasa to the ICD and other destinations.
