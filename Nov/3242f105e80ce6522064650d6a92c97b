“THE COURTS MUST NOT BE USED TO OPRESS WORKERS!” that was the message from the Kenya Medical Practitioners Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) Secretary General Dr. Ouma Oluga after he was found guilty of contempt of court charges and consequently sentenced to a one month non?custodial term by the Employment and labor relations court in Nyeri. Oluga and his co accused, South Rift branch secretary Davji Atella were however released upon payment of 10,000 shillings each. KMPDU now threatens to in turn sue county governments, for their failure to honor CBAs.
