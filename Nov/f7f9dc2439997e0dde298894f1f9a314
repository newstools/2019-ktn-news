Dadaab MP mohamed dahiye is now calling on the one month vetting exercise to de register kenyans whose finger prints appear in the UNHCR data base to be extended. Dahiye says that the number of persons who have been vetted since the exercise was officially launched on 11th November is too low. The process is scheduled to end on December 11th but barely a quarter of those affected have been covered.
