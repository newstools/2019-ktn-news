Jeeva quarters welfare group has petitioned the county government of Nairobi to stop the forced eviction against the urban poor and to resettle them within framework of the governmentâ€™s big four agenda program on housing. They want the county government to withdraw all eviction letters issued to all sitting tenants of Jevanjee old bachelors quarters estate. The group also wants authorities to make public the contracts signed with the private developers and that no sitting tenants should be rendered homeless through the re development process.
