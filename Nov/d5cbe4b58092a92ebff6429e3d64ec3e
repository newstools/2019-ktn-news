Jubilee party has made changes in its Nairobi county assembly representation. Majority leader Abdi Guyo has now been replaced by Charles Thuo Wakarindi. This takes place at a time when Guyo himself appeared before the directorate of criminal investigations officers in connection with multiple cases of chaos and confrontations in the Nairobi county assembly premises.
