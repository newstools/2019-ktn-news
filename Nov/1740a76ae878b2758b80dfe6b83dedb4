The Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) report could make or break careers in the country’s political arena. President Uhuru Kenyatta, who met chairman of the BBI Taskforce, Garissa Senator Yusuf Haji last week, will receive the report tomorrow. “They are free to bring it (BBI report) to me on Tuesday and I assure you that as soon as I receive it, I will personally go through it and hand it to Kenyans,” said President Kenyatta. The president has hinged hislegacy on the report that will also affect the political future of his deputy William Ruto and Opposition leader Raila Odinga.
