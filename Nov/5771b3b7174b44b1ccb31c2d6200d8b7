National women's football team Harambee Starlets are winners of the 2019 Cecafa Championship. Starlets dethroned holders Tanzania's Kilimanjaro Queens 2-0 in yesterday's final at the Chamazi Stadium, Dar es Saalam to lift their first ever regional title. Once again, impressive Vihiga Queens forward Jentrix Shikangwa stole the show, coming off the bench to score a second half brace to take her tournament's tally to nine goals. It was a sweet revenge for Starlets, who lost 2-1 to Tanzania in the 2016 final in Gulu, Uganda and a fitting moment of redemption for the players after being eliminated by Zambia in the fourth round of the 2020 Olympic qualifiers. The teenage sensation broke the deadlock from the spot in the 71st minute before doubling the lead with a wonderful strike in the 87th minute.Â The victory saw Kenya claim the regional title on an unbeaten record and without conceding a single goal throughout the competition.
