Ousted Nairobi County Assembly Majority Leader Abdi Guyo now alleges that Governor Mike Sonko is the city’s top cartel who has been plundering public resources and pretending to be clean. The embattled Matopeni MCA states that he has evidence to that effect and that he will be forwarding the same to the DCI and the EACC to prove that the governor is a beneficiary of bribes from the capital city's private developers.
