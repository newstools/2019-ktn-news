President Uhuru Kenyatta this morning officially opened the international conference on population and development summit at the KICC. The three day summit is the second one after the inaugural one that took place in Cairo 25 years ago where 179 governments adopted an action plan for women's empowerment and sexual and reproductive health rights.
