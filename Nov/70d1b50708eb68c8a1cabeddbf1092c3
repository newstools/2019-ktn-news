Last weekend we reported about several counterfeit products nabbed at the Kenya Tanzania border town of Namanga. The goods were reportedly imported through the Dar es salaam port and were worth over 20 million shillings. After three days of silence the Anti counterfeit authority has today spoken about the multimillion seizure and steered away from mentioning those involved in this mega tax evasion crime.
