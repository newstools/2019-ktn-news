The National Assembly departmental committee on transport has urged the government to prioritize the nationalization of Kenya Airways in the proposed restructuring of the Kenya civil aviation sector.  The committee’s chairman, David Pkosing says taxpayers stand to loose 75 billion shillings guaranteed by the government to KQ debtors in the event that the national carrier collapses.  Kenya Airways board of management chairman Michael Joseph told Parliament that the loss making Kenya Airways will cease to be a strategic asset by April next year should the government fail to rescue it through nationalization.
