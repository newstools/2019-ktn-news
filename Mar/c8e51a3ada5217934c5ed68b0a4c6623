A section of leaders from Wajir County have criticized the replacement of Amina Mohamed with Professor George Magoha in the ministry of education. Led by Wajir east MP Rashid Kassim, the leaders termed changes made in the cabinet by President Uhuru Kenyatta as an affront to nomadic communities. Speaking during the awarding of bursaries amounting to 20m shillings to needy students, they faulted Magoha's leadership in KNEC for cancellation of exam results for 987 students from northern KenyaÂ who sat for final exams last year.
