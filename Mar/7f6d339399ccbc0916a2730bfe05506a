President Uhuru Kenyatta’s move to hold talks with Deputy President William Ruto at Ruto’s office in Nairobi has elicited mixed reactions.  A statement by the president’s press unit said that Kenyatta and Ruto shared a working lunch at the dp’s office during which the two leaders discussed matters related to the government’s development agenda. The lunch comes two days after minority leader in the senate, Siaya senator James Orengo said there was a plot by Raila Odinga allies to impeach the deputy president over alleged gross misconduct. Was the meeting an attempt by the president to extend an olive branch to his embattled deputy?
