The national council of churches of Kenya, NCCK, wants the independent electoral and boundaries commission act amended to allow political parties’ appointees to the commission.  NCCK says the political party appointees should be part-time commissioners and should be not more than three.  However, the elections observation group, ELOG, says commissioners should be appointed based on the current expert model.
