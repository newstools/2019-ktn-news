The government has released over 12 billion shillings to be disbursed to the elderly and the vulnerable in the society under the Inua Jamii program. Over 700,000 beneficiaries are set to receive their stipends that had been delayed for 6 months to allow beneficiaries to enroll under the consolidated cash transfer programme. Labour and social protection Permanent Secretary Nelson Marwa has directed the banks to release the money to the beneficiaries immediately or face dire consequences.
