At least two people have been killed and several houses torched in renewed conflict along the Isiolo?Garissa border. Northeastern regional commissioner Mohamed Birik has attributed the conflict to politics saying politicians from both Isiolo and Garissa have been inciting locals into violence. Bodies of the slain villagers were laid to rest today in a tense atmosphere even as police continue with investigations on the violence that is also blamed on police reservists. The latest killings come barely two days after two teenage herders were killed and one injured in el Digale at the border of Isiolo and Garissa. Authorities say competition over water and pasture is partly to blame for the escalation of conflict between the two communities.
