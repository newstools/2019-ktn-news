President Uhuru Kenyatta opened the devolution conference today with a warning to governors that his anti?corruption war is soon headed to the counties and that nobody should ethnicise or politicise the renewed fight. Kenyatta made the warning even as governors appeared to lament that they are yet to be briefed on the scope of their role in helping the president implement the big four agenda.
