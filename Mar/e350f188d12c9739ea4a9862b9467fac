Remember one Sammy Black and his wife Virginia Njeri. Their romantic and beautiful photos tossed the social media in to a buzz after they were captured showing true love to the world while in the streets. This earned them a holiday trip to Diani, in the Kenyan coast which came with a promise of changing their lives for good. The good life they were treated to lasted for only four months. The famous street couple that hit the headlines for the better part of the year 2018 is back in the streets.
