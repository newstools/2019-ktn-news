Tension and divisions within the ruling jubilee party now seem to be escalating to boiling point level as the crusade against corruption continues to take shape. While the anti?Ruto brigade continues to pile pressure on investigating bodies to tighten their grip and arrest all those involved in graft, the pro?Ruto team have come out crying foul that the deputy president was being targeted due to his 2022presidentialambitions. Deputy President William Ruto has alluded that there is a plot to politicize the war against graft and taint the jubilee regime as the most corrupt government in the countryâ€™s history.
