Baringo Senator Gideon Moi has led a relief food distribution exercise in Tiaty, in the county of Baringo. The senator decries the drought that has become an annual phenomenon with very little long?term intervention from the county and the national governments. Devolution cabinet secretary Eugene Wamalwa says the government had released 1000 bags of maize and 500 bags of beans to be distributed to hungry families in Tiaty.
