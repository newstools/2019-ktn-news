The extension of the 120km Nairobi?Naivasha standard gauge railway (SGR) will now be completed in August and not June as earlier projected. The delay will cost the government extra cash with the delay blamed on the compensation wrangles around the 5km section in Ngong area. This came as it emerged that 90 percent of the works on the modern railway line was complete with various passengers terminus already ready. According to Chinese communications construction company (CCCC) communication officer Jasper Lui, they were optimistic that the row in Ngong would be resolved soon. Addressing the press after touring the Mai Mahiu and Suswa stations, Lui said that they were working with the state agencies and the affected persons to resolve the issue.
