A section of legislators, calling themselves ‘team Kenya’, led by Tiaty member of parliament William Kamket, are threatening to storm into offices of individuals facing corruption allegations, if the offices of the DPP and DCI, do not act with speed. Speaking in Churo Amaya, in Baringo, during a fundraiser for 5 women groups, the leaders want DPP Noordin haji, and DCI George Kinoti, to speed up the process to have all the corrupt arrested and charged.
