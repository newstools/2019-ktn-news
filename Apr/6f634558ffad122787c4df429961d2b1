It has been tradition that farmers till their lands and wait for the rains to fall especially during the long rains. However, this year, the rains have delayed and many farmers are disappointed. There are those who had already planted their crops while awaiting the rains, whereas there are those who were waiting for a signal to prepare their farms and are not sure whether to go ahead and plant after some parts of the country experienced showers. On the other hand, some have been forced to use alternative methods of farming. So which way do the farmers go? Or will the country be food insecure in the near future?
