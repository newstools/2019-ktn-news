The Kenya Animal Genetic Resources Centre is located on a 200-acre piece of land in Nairobi’s lower Kabete area. 
Started in 1946 by the Kenya Government, the centre produces and distributes bull semen for use by the country’s livestock farmers. 
With time, the centre’s mandate has grown to include providing artificial insemination (AI) training to farmers and supplying equipment for AI services in the country. 
The price for the semen varies from one bull to another depending on market demand for the said bull and the distance your inseminator or agent will cover to make delivery.
