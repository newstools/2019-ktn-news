Human rights activists under the red vest movement took to the streets of Nairobi Tuesday to voice their outcry against runaway corruption in government. However, the demonstrators had a rough time making their way out of Uhuru Park due to stiff police resistance. One of the protestors was eventually arrested when the demos materialized in the city centre.
