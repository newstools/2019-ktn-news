Residents of Umoja in Nairobi are in shock after a mutilated body of a woman was found dumped in a pile of trash by the roadside. The dismembered body was stuffed in twoÂ shopping bags. Residents could not identify the body and the police too have not found any identification document on her. It is not clear if the woman is from Umoja or she was killed elsewhere and the body dumped there. The police have moved the body to the city mortuary.
