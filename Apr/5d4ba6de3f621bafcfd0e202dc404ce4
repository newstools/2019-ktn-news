The Anglican Church has now banned fundraising in their sanctuaries by politicians. While asking bishops and the clergy not to allow Harambee’s in church, the Anglican archbishop Dr. Jackson ole Sapit argued that corrupt leaders were using the church to sanitize what they have looted from public coffers. This coming against the backdrop of war of words between opposition leaders and deputy president William Ruto over the question on where the deputy president gets money to donate to churches every weekend.
