Meanwhile, Deputy President William Ruto was conspicuously missing in action as the government launched Huduma Namba. KTN News understands that the deputy president had been scheduled to lead the launch in the county of Kakamega. He had been expected to arrive at Kambi ya kwanza in Malava to lead the listing there. Instead, he was represented by Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed who was accompanied by her devolution andÂ agriculture counterparts Eugene Wamalwa and Mwangi Kiunjuri as well as Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya. Ruto spent the day meeting the vice president of the Cuban council of state and Ministers Ines Maria Chapman, who is in the country for an official visit.
