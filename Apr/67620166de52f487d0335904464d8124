Ugenya constituency by?election campaigns are on the homestretch and as the parliamentary seat temperatures soar, so does national politics. While addressing a rally in Ugenya today, Siaya Senator James Orengio and ODM chairman John Mbadi took a swipe at Deputy President William Ruto saying plans are underway to unseat him. This comes a just a week after Senator Orengo intimated that he is drafting a motion to impeach the deputy president.
