A major storm is brewing between the Federation of Kenyan employers, FKE, and the central organization of trade unions, COTU, ahead of Labour Day celebrations tomorrow. This, after COTU stuck to its plan to demand for a 15% minimum wage increment from President Uhuru Kenyatta in tomorrow’s celebrations against FKE’s objection. The government’s plan to raise funds for its affordable housing scheme by imposing a 1.5% levy on workers’ gross salaries now lies in jeopardy. COTU maintains its workers will object any such scheme unless their 15% salary increment is met.
