More than 200 residents of the county of Isiolo are counting their losses after falling prey to reported conmen who deceived them that they had organized for an appointment with deputy president William Ruto this morning in Nairobi. The said conmen told the unsuspecting residents to contribute some money to facilitate the trip from Isiolo to Nairobi, but disappeared without a trace.
