Chief executive officer of PKF Kenya, David Kabeberi was today at pains to explain why his consulting firm advised the ministry of health to lease specialized medical equipment, to all the 47 county governments, instead of buying them directly from manufacturer. However, Kabeberi insists that PKF Kenya never advised the government to lease the equipment saying the decision had already been made by the ministry of health.Â  Kabeberi said his firm was also never involved when the ministry varied the annual cost of leasing the equipment by a one hundred per cent increment.
