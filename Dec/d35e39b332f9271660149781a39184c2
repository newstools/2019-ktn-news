Nairobi senator Johnson Sakaja has writen to the speaker of the senate Ken Lusaka requesting him to urgently call for a special sitting of the senate to discuss the exceptional leadership situation in Nairobi. Sakaja’s request is informed by the stringent bail terms given to Nairobi city count governor Mike Sonko that include not accessing his city hall office for the entire time of his trial. In the letter penned this afternoon, Sajaka says, quote, “ seeing that Nairobi does not have a deputy governor as is the case of Kimabu county where a similar direction has been given, serious concerns and questions have arisen as to how the county will be run in the interim period.”Sakaja further says the special sitting will seek to give direction on whether to take legal or legislative action in the interest of the people of Nairobi.
