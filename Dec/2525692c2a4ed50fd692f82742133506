The national government has committed to construct the killer Enziu bridge which connects the road from Nuu to Nguni, at river Enziu, Mwingi central constituency in Kitui county, following many lives that the bridge has claimed during heavy rains. At least 10 people have died on the bridge since April last year, with the bridge coming to the limelight when 4 people drowned in the river last year. Speaking at the bridge when he visited Mwingi central constituency principal secretary in the state department of public works professor Paul Maringa said that the government was keen in ensuring the welfare of her citizens. Maringa said as a short term measure, the government would first improve the drift which is almost being swept by water, for residents to use as the tendering process goes on.
