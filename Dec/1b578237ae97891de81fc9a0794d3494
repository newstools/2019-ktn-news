Chief magistrate Eric Ogola has rejected an application by the Kenya ports authority managing director Daniel Manduku to stop his arrest. Ogola, also dismissed Manduku’s claim that investigations on corruption should only be carried out by the ethics and anti corruption commission, and not the directorate of criminal investigations. Ogola however granted Manduku an anticipatory cash bail of half a million shillings to deter police from harassing him during any arrest and explained the police were free to make any arrest when they deem fit.
