In a move that puts the spotlight firmly on the integrity of the ministry of interior and coordination of national government, Nyeri county commissioner David Yatich Kipkemei, has been transferred to the county of Homabay county. This comes just days after chaos erupted at an event attended by deputy president William Ruto. Yatich’s transfer comes amidst heightened calls by political leaders from one political divide, to have the entire security apparatus in Nyeri reshuffled. KTN reports on the wide scope of lawful yet seemingly dubious transfers, said to be politically instigated, that have in recent days rocked government operations in the county.
