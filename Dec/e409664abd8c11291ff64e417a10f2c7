Two administration police officers have been arraigned at the Milimani law courts over charges of fraud. The two are accused of receiving 2.4 million shillings from pioneer insurance limited through false pretense. The duo Dominic Masengeli Maina and David Maina were presented before principle magistrate Francis Andai for conspiring to defraud pioneer insurance limited. Officer Dominic Masengeli is said to have made a false claim that he was involved in road accident that left his lower and upper limps amputated. The two denied the charges levelled against them and were released on a cash bail of half a million shillings. The case will be heard on 16th march next year.
