After the much anticipated BBI report launch at the Bomas of Kenya, politicians from different factions started doing what they do best, politickingâ€¦Those allied to DP William Ruto were quick to laud the BBI task-force for coming up with a document, they say, is right for Kenyans albeit the implementation process was where they differ with their counterpart allied to AU Special Envoy Raila Odinga. Ruto allies are of the opinion that the report should take the Parliamentary route, while the Raila brigade say Kenyans should be left to decide the fate of the document i.e. a referendum.
