Kiambu county assembly will proceed with house business until 19th of this month after the impeachment motion of governor Ferninand Waititu and his deputy James Nyoro failed to go through, because the criteria by which the complaints were acquired failed to abide by the law. KTN News understands that members in support of Waititu did not attend today's special sitting.
