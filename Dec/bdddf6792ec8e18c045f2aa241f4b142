So what's the next step for the building bridges initiative after the report was launched? This seems to be the elephant in the room as the political class continues to differ on whether parliament should now own the process or if the final document should be subjected to a referendum.

Oloo says the report also touched on some protected clauses that need amendments as per article 257 of the constitution on a popular initiative.
