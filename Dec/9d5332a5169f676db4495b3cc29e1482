The acting controller of budget Stephen Masha has urged the senate to uphold the decision by the acting cabinet secretary national treasury Ukur Yattani stopping transfer of equitable share of revenue to fifteen county governments due to failure to pay pending bills.Â  The controller of budget says non payment of eligible pending bills constitute a serious material breach of the public finance management act and the affected counties must develop a recovery plan to clear the debts before funding could resume.
