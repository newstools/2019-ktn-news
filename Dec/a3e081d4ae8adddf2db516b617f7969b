The Council of Governors led by its chair, Wycliffe Oparanya has said it will move to court to challenge an earlier court ruling by High Court judge Mumbi Ngugi that stated governors facing corruption charges to be barred from accessing office for the entire duration of their trial. The move comes days after Mike Sonko became the third governor to be barred from accessing office following his arraignment in court where he was charged with 19 counts of economic crimes.
