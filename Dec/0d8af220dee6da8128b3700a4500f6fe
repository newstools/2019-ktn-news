Following ugly clashes that rocked a fundraiser attended by deputy president william Ruto in Nyeri on sunday, a section of members of the Nyeri county assembly are now calling for the arrest of Nyeri town member of parliament Ngunjiri Wambugu, accusing him of instigating the violence. The ward representatives have further called on investigative agencies to revisit past skirmishes, even as they defend assembly deputy speaker Samuel Kariuki against accusations of fleeing from lawful arrest.
