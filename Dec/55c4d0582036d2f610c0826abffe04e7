A criminal case pitting Nairobi governor Mike Mbuvi Sonko against the police failed to take off in a Voi court as the governor was not available to take plea against three counts of assault, resisting arrest and public disturbance. The packed court was told that Sonko still unwell and needed more time before he can appear in court. A battery of police had camped outside the court as early as 1 am and anyone going to the courts had to be vetted.
