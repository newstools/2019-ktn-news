The next occupant of the office of the auditor general is yet to be identified after the recent recruitment exercise failed to find a successor to Edward Ouko. Sammy Onyango the chair of the panel appointed to find Kenya's next auditor general says the position attracted seventy applicants and seventeen were shortlisted for interviews. Out of the seventeen  two women and fifteen men  the panel did not find a suitable candidate citing their failure to the personality, diplomacy and tact tests.  The public service commission chairperson Stephen Kirogo now says the position will be re advertised on friday.
