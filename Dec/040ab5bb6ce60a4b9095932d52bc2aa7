Second liberation hero Charles Rubia was today laid to rest at his Murang'a home in a ceremony that president Uhuru Kenyatta and other leaders attended. The president used the occasion to ask leaders to spread peace and national cohesion and use their freedom of expression to fight corruption, tribalism and injustice. And in a veiled response to Miguna Migunaâ€™s planned return to Kenya next week, the president said no one will interfere with his plans.
