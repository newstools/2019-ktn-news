The port city of Mombasa is gearing up for a holiday boom with hotels already reporting an occupancy rate of between 75% and 85%. Industry stakeholders are however appealing to the government to increase the frequency of passenger services at the SGR to enable travel of more visitors. The county also anticipates an increase in foreign tourist arrivals with the launch of the new cruise ship terminal at Kilindini harbor. The terminal will also present new opportunities for those looking to take up cruises across the region.
