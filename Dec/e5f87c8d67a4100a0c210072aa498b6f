Controversy continues to rock the marking of this year's KCSE business studies paper, after examiners declined to offer their services over poor pay and deplorable working conditions. The exercise began on Saturday but teachers are said to be unhappy with the pay of 46 shillings per script. Already the Kenya union of post primary teachers, KUPPET, has issued a seven day notice to the ministry of education and the examination council demanding and immediate fixing of the situation, failure to which examiners will be called upon to withdraw.
