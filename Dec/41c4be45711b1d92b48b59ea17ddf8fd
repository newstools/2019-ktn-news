A magistrate court Nyeri today released Nyeri County Assembly Deputy Speaker Samuel Kariuki on a cash bail of 50,000 shillings, pending the hearing of a case against him on the 26th March 2020. The MCA was charged with four counts including assault and malicious damage to property before Nyeri senior principal magistrate Mathias Okuche. He was captured on camera assaulting a man during chaos that erupted at a function attended by Deputy President Dr William Ruto a week ago.
