There was drama in Naivasha after members of the Isahakia community invaded a parcel of land they claimed belonged to them saying it had been grabbed by powerful forces. Traffic along NairobiÂ  Nakuru highway was temporarily affected as the young and the old from the community embarked on building make shift tents vowing not to move from the land.
