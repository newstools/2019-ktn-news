The parliamentary committee on labor and social welfare, wants the duration of training in youth polytechnics and vocational courses to be reduced. An estimated preferred duration would be around six months, so as to attract youths. The committee which is touring all facilities in Kenya said many youth are shying away from vocational courses due to the prolonged period of time taken to complete the courses. Committee chairman and Bura member of parliament, Ali Wario was speaking in Gede youth polytechnic and expressed the need for this measure.
