The Kenya national union of teachers, KNUT officials now want the teachers service commission, to reinstate some 80,000 teachers, who were illegally offloaded from the union's membership register. Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion also says that TSCâ€™s failure to remit union dues has starved KNUT of cash, crippling the union's operations.
