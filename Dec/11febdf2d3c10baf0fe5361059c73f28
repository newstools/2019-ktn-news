Scrotal elephantiasis has become a major problem in the Coast region especially in Kilifi county where husbands have been abandoned by wives and families broken after flames between the sheets went down. It is a rare but serious and debilitating condition that leads to massive scrotal swelling. The entire scrotum becomes extremely large as lymph fluid and tissue accumulates.
