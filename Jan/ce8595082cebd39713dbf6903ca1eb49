Activist Okiya Omtata has threatened to sue over the rollout of the new education curriculum. The activist argues that stakeholders were not adequately consulted over the move. He wondered why the government was rushing to implement the new curriculum risking smooth transition. Omtatah also wants the Kenya National Examination Council to ensure final exam papers are returned to schools after marking.
