Meanwhile, last week’s terror attack at Dusit d2 complex that shook the country, brought to the fore a real manifestation of a mother’s undying love for her child irrespective of the situation. Phylis Ouko who was rescued from the hotel on her wheelchair, defied her condition as well as pleas to be rushed to hospital by stating that she would not leave the Dusit complex until her daughter comes out, alive or dead. True to her stand, she withstood hunger Pangs, braved the cold night, and waited anxiously on her wheelchair for 13 straight hours until 4am when her daughter was finally rescued.
