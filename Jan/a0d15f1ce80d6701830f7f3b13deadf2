Controversial rapper Henry Ohanga popularly known as Octopizzo has been accused of committing murder.
A family at Nairobi's Woodley estate says Octopizzo assaulted 19 year old Kenneth Abom Thursday afternoon forcing him to jump from the fourth floor of their building leading to his death.
The former Strathmore University student succumbed to chest injuries on Saturday shortly after his admission at the Kenyatta National Hospital.
