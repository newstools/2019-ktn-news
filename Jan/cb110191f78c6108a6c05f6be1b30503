Politics on Maasai mau forest and eviction of illegal settlers dominated the funeral of the late Samuel Soitanae ole Koriata in Narok County that was attended by Deputy President William Ruto.  The deputy president defended the government over last year’s order to stop illegal logging and order to evict 2,500 people in a bid to conserve the Mau complex.
