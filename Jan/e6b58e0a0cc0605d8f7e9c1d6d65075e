Affordable healthcare which is among the government’s big 4 agenda has remained a nightmare in most parts of Baringo county for decades now. In fact, in some areas such as Mukutani ward, in Baringo south, locals have ended up converting health facilities around them into residential homes due to the facilities remaining unoccupied for lacking the required staff and equipment. Residents here are also forced to walk for tens of kilometers to access health care.
