Kamba council of Elders has come out strongly to support Wiper Leader Kalonzo Musyoka on his decision to work with president Uhuru Kenyatta. The elders have also cautioned dissenting voices in the region who have expressed displeasure with the handshake between president Uhuru and opposition leader Raila Odinga. They say even if Kalonzo was to become ‘an errand boy’ of the president they wouldn’t mind as long as it brought development to the people of Ukambani. The elders spoke in Kibwezi town in Makueni County
