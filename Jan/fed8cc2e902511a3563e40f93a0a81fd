Kenya is set to have its first-ever paperless national population and housing census in August this year. Kenya national bureau of statistics will acquire about 164,000 mobile devices for the exercise. Treasury CS, Henry Rotich says the use of technology will enhance the quality of data in line with the United Nations recommendations. The census is conducted every ten years and the last one in 2009 put Kenya’s population at 38.6 million. Analysts estimate the current population could be 52 million. The August census will cost nearly 18 billion shillings and will be the first under the devolved system.
