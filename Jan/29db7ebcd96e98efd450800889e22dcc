A team of surgeons at Kenyatta hospital have successfully reconstructed a 16-year-old boy's genitalia. The patient is said to have presented with a traumatic amputation of the penis o the dawn of 18th December last year, after his penis was chopped off in a bizarre incident. The operation took over seven hours and is the first successful one in the country. The team of doctors was led by Professor Stanely Kahinga. The medics advise that such cases can be rescued when the disturbed organ is kept under cool temperatures and quick medical attention sought. This is another landmark surgery at the country's largest referral hospital, coming barely a year after specialists from the same facility reattached the severed arm of a boy.
