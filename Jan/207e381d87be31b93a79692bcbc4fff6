President Uhuru Kenyatta has today read a riot act to government officials saying his administration will fight terrorism at all cost and also act tough on corrupt officials as well as those engaging in wastage of public resources. Addressing the newly appointed regional commissioners, regional police commanders, the county commissioners, and county commanders in Mombasa, the president said no stone will be left unturned until culprits in last week’s heinous acts are brought to book.
