The South Eastern Kenya Economic BLOC, SEKEB, held its first joint cabinet meeting and signed a deal aimed at economic empowerment.  The three governors from Makueni, Machakos and Kitui counties said the economic bloc would revolutionize Ukambani region by maximizing resource use and turn the people into producers rather than consumers.  The agreement will also see the establishment of a regional bank.
