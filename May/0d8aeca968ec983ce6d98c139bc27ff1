A recent report by the auditor general has indicated that Kenyatta University, the University of Nairobi and Multimedia University are operating on bank overdrafts besides failing to remit billions in employees' statutory deductions. Now, the University of Nairobi workers are calling upon the government to intervene and ensure that their dues are paid in full. The university is accused of failing to remit in excess of 2 billion shillings worth of deductions to relevant agencies.
