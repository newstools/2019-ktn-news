A Kisumu based religious leader and his brother are in police custody for allegedly defiling his four-year-old daughter. The two took the minor to Ahero county hospital on the ninth of May, claiming she had fallen off from a pickup truck, only for the doctor to establish that the minor had been defiled. The family has refused to comment on the matter.
