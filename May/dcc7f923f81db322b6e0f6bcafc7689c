National Olympic committee of Kenya President Paul Tergat has said that one’s talent isn’t supposed to be curtailed due to their gender issue. This comes just 10 days after Kenya had to drop two female sprinters from the world relay team due to high testosterone levels after the court of arbitration for sport ruled that female athlete with elevated testosterone will have to take suppressive treatment if they wish to compete as women in certain events. Tergat has also condemned the doping menace in the country.
