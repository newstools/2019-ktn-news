Amani National Congress nominated Member of Parliament Godfrey Osotsi could be hours away from losing his parliamentary seat. This is after the registrar of political parties removed his name from the membership of the party. ANC Secretary General Barrack Muluka has already communicated to the clerk of the national assembly notifying him of the same.  Osotsi who is currently out of the country says he will be going to court to challenge the decision, even though his initial attempt was dismissed.
