Education Cabinet Secretary Professor George Magoha has launched the new curriculum policy. The policy gives a framework of how the ministry will ensure seamless implementation of the new education system that was rolled out at the start of this year in pre?primary one and two, as well as grade 1, 2 and 3. The ministry of education maintains that there shall be no turning back on the new curriculum despite fierce opposition from stakeholders such as the Kenya national union of teachers. KNUT Secretary General Wilson Sossion insists that the process is flawed, lacks legitimacy and with no public participation.
