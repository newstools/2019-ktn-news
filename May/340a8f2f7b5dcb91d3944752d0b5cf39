The Senate Committee on Agriculture has directed the Auditor General Edward Ouko to conduct a forensic audit of the multi-billion shillings Galana Kulalu food security project after it emerged that only 600 acres of the model 5,000 acre farm are under maize cultivation.  The contract sum for the targeted 10,000 acres was Ksh.7.2 billion.  So far, ksh.6.1 billion has been paid with almost half the works not completed.  The Principal Secretary for Irrigation Prof. Fred Segor shocked senators when he said Ksh.580 million was used to clear the bushes.
