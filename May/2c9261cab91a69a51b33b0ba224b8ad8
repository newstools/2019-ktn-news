Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu will this evening be resting easy after the high court quashed her prosecution. In a 5?judge bench ruling, likely to be viewed as a setback to the office of the director of public prosecutions, the court faulted the DCI, and the DPP, for obtaining bank records, of the deputy chief justice using a court order that had no bearing to the case. And now,Â DPP Noordin haji and DCI George Kinoti are already planning to appeal that decision.
