The Kenya Bureau of Standards has banned import of used car spare parts in an agenda to gradually phase out second-hand vehicles. A lot of people will be affected in the supply chain. This move comes after KEBS allowedÂ the importation of cars aged 8 years. This move has not gone down well with dealers of second-hand spare parts.
