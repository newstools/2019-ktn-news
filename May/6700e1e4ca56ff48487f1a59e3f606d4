The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, IEBC, has proposed a change to the law to allow county and national elections to be conducted on different dates.  In a raft of proposals tabled before the Senate, IEBC says commissioners should be appointed in office for the entire electoral cycle and or at least two years to the general election. The commission also wants timelines for the hearing and determination of presidential petitions to be increased from 14 to 30 days.
