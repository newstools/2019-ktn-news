Two people, are nursing gunshot wounds this evening in Baruwako area of Wajir County, after police opened fire on a crowd of protesters who had intercepted a convoy ferrying relief food in the county. The cause of the uproar is believed to be political even though the residents of the county denied claims that the demonstration was targeting to taint the image, of Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi Mahmoud, and paint him in bad light since he was in charge of the food that was being ferried.
