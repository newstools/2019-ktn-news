The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission has today re-advertised the position of CEO close to five months since an initial deadline it had set for applications elapsed. The post has been vacant since October last year when the commission sacked former CEO Ezra Chiloba over procurement queries relating to the 2017 polls. The new advertisement which follows a court case challenging the recruitment process comes even as questions linger among stakeholders on the status of the commission.
