Women living with various disabilities have decried the rising cases of violence against people with disabilities in the country. This barely a week after news reports of a physically disabled woman who was sexually assaulted and murdered in Machakos. The women under the umbrella of United disabled persons of Kenya want the police to apprehend the perpetrators of these crimes and bring them to book.
