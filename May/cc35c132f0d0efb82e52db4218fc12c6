In 2015, Kenya stood with her shoulders high among 165 countries that participated in the Los Angeles Special Olympics after bagging a total of 40 medals, 26 among them, gold.  Then class seven pupil Susan Gatwiri put her best foot forward to not only participate in the competitions but also bag two gold medals. But three years later and the girl who lifted the country’s flag high is languishing in abject poverty. She works as a house help in Nyeri after failing to raise school fees to proceed to secondary school.
