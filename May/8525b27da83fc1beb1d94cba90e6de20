Kikuyu Member of Parliament Kimani Icungwa has dismissed claims by Kiambu County Woman Representative Gathoni wa Muchomba that a section of central Kenya MPs were working in cahoots with outsiders to have President Uhuru Kenyatta impeached, a plot that was thwarted by the handshake. While Icungwa is blaming interior PS Karanja KibichoÂ for the mess in jubilee, Gathoni Wamuchoma insists her claims are true adding that even during this years state of the nation address, jubilee leaders allied to the Tangatanga outfit had planned to heckle the president but halted the plot after realizing NASA MPs were not interested in the idea.
