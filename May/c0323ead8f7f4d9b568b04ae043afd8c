Residents of the usually quiet leafy suburb of Gigiri here in Nairobi were treated to early morning drama following demolition of property said to have been erected, on land that had been set aside for the construction of a fire station. However, the developer says there is an agreement with the county government of Nairobi to occupy part of the land pending a court determination on the dispute.
