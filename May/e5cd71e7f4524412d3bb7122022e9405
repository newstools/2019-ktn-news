Pupils at Busanja primary school in Chepkube, Mount Elgon, in the county of Bungoma have been forced to take their lessons in the open field after the tree that was being used as their super classroom was fenced off by a neighbour. The school that was founded back in 1970 and has students up to standard 7 does not have a single classroom.
