The trial of Migori Governor Okoth Obado and two others over the murder of Rongo University student Sharon Otieno failed to kick off this morning after defense lawyers sought time to reply to an application by the state. The prosecution has filed an objection to another application by Obado’s co?accused, his personal assistant Michael Oyamo and former Migori county clerk Caspal Obiero who are seeking to have high court Judge Justice Jessie Lesit withdrawn from hearing the case citing bias. Justice Lesit has given the defense team’s 8 days to file their response before the application by the prosecution is heard on the 29th of May. The trial was initially slated to run from today until the 17th of this month. Sharon Otieno who was seven months pregnant was raped, stabbed eight times and strangled and before her body was dumped in Kodera forest in the county of Homa bay in September last year.
