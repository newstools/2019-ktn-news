The County Government of Tana River has announced that there is a looming food crisis likely to affect nearly three hundred thousand residents of the coastal county. Tana River Governor Dhadho Godhana says he is planning on procuring contracts for relief food distribution especially around the areas of Bura and Hola even as he pleaded with the national government to wave off more than 67 million shillings in debt owed to the government by maize farmers in the county.
