The labour Court in Nairobi has overturned the decision to impeach Nairobi County Assembly Speaker Beatrice Elachi. Judge Maureen Onyango of the employment and labour relations court ruled that the house committee abused their powers by failing to give Elachi a fair process. The court further prohibited the Nairobi county assembly from entertaining or debating any motion for the removal of Elachi without according her due process.Â  Elachi went to court last year after she was impeached by the county assembly while she was away from office on official duty.
