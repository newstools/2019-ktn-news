The Kalenjin community has been urged to unite and focus on development, instead of politicking. Leaders led by Baringo Senator Gideon Moi were speaking in Salawa during the burial of Mwalimu Wilson Kipkoros Chepkoit who is the father of Standard Group’s Nakuru Bureau Chief Alex Kiprotich Chepkoit. The family promised to establish a center of excellence in honour of their father at Salawa which will act as a library and will be free for all.
