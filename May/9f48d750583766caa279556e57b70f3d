The National Environmental Management Authority, NEMA is today inspecting the cleanliness of Nairobi rivers ecosystem while focusing a keen eye on effluent discharge to the troubled rivers. This is part of NEMA's 100-day rapid results initiative in a bid to bring all facilities countrywide into compliance. The initiative, which is a collaboration between NEMA and the county government of Nairobi, also aims to crackdown on illegal discharge into the sewers, rivers and into the environment. NEMA has warned that it will shut down noncompliant companies.
