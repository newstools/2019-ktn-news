Kenya ranks among the 10 countries in the world with the highest maternal deaths according to the world health organisation. About 6300 women die every year in Kenya while giving birth, according to data from the national council for population and development. These deaths are mostly due to delays in accessing care while in labour. The renovation of Mrima maternity hospital in Likoni is an example of an initiative that bridges that gap for mothers.
