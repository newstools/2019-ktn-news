There could be at least 40 new political parties in the run-up to the next general election. The registrar of political parties has received these applications since the 2017 polls. This comes as a party said to be associated with Gatundu South legislator Moses Kuria was also fronted for registration. An attempt to abbreviate the Transformational National Alliance party as TNA or use of the initial symbols of President Uhuru Kenyattaâ€™s defunct TNA party have been blocked.
